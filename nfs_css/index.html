          released its first title, The Need for Speed, in 1994. The most recent

          The Need for Speed series was originally developed by Distinctive
          Software, a video game studio based in Vancouver, British Columbia,
          Canada. Prior to Electronic Arts' purchase of the company in 1991, it
          had created popular racing games such as Stunts and Test Drive II: The
          Duel. After the purchase, the company was renamed Electronic Arts (EA)
          Canada. The company capitalized on its experience in the domain by
          developing the Need for Speed series in late 1992.EA Canada continued
          to develop and expand the Need for Speed franchise up to 2002, when
          another Vancouver-based gaming company, named Black Box Games, was
          acquired by EA and contracted to continue the series with Need for
          Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.Later, Slightly Mad Studios was brought in,
          releasing Need for Speed: Shift in 2009, followed by a sequel, Shift
          2: Unleashed, in 2011. UK-based company Criterion Games would release
          Hot Pursuit in 2010. The game introduced a social platform, titled
          Autolog, which allows players to track game progress, view
          leaderboards, share screenshots with friends, among other features.At
          E3 2012, Criterion Games vice president Alex Ward announced that
          random developers would no longer be developing NFS titles. Ward
          wouldn't confirm that all Need for Speed games in the future would be
          developed entirely by Criterion, but he did say the studio would have
          "strong involvement" in them and would have control over which NFS
          titles would be released in the future. In August 2013, following the
          downsizing of Criterion Games, Swedish developer Ghost Games would
          become the main studio for the franchise and oversee future
          development.At the time, 80% of Ghost Games' work force consisted of
          former Criterion Games employees.Ghost Games would develop 2013's Need
          for Speed Rivals, the 2015 Need for Speed reboot, 2017's Need for
          Speed Payback, and 2019's Need for Speed Heat. In February 2020,
          Criterion regained oversight of the franchise.
